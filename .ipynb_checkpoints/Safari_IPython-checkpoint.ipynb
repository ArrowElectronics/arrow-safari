    "# Safari 96Boards Demo Featuring Analog Devices' AD7124\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This demo is designed to demonstrate the functionality of the AD7124 using Arrow's Safari 96Board mezzanine card.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Components:\n",
    "1. [Novtech Meerkat 96Board](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/meerkat-001-013-0202/novtech-inc)\n",
    "2. Arrow Safari Multi-Sensor Input 96Boards Mezzanine Card - p/n 96B-05SENSORADC-V2.0-ARROW\n",
    "3. [12V/2A Power Supply](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/wm24p6-12-a-ql/autec-power-systems) (Not Pictured)\n",

    "<img src=\"images/Safari-Kit-Unassembled.JPG\" alt=\"Safari Kit Unassembled\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flashing The SD Card\n",
    "For the Safari kit the Meerkat board requires an 8GB microSD card with the necessary software downloaded (flashed) onto it. Here are the instructions for doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain 8GB or larger microSD card\n",
    "2. Download the image 'safari_v2.img.bz2'\n",
    "3. Extract image using winzip, 7zip, etc. File name will now be 'safari_v2.img'\n",
    "4. Format microSD card to 'FAT32' using 'SD Card Formatter' or another program\n",
    "5. Using balenaEtcher or similar software transfer image from your PC to the memory card\n",
    "\n",
    "## Board Preparation\n",
    "### 1. Insert Memory Card\n",
    "Insert microSD card containing Linux OS and Safari demo into Meerkat.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/SD_card.JPG\" alt=\"SD Card\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Set DIP Switch to Boot from SD Card\n",
    "Turn the Meerkat board over and identify the small DPDT DIP switch on the bottom. Make sure both switches 1 and 2 are in the ON position as shown.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Meerkat_bottom_DIP.jpeg\" alt=\"Meerkat Bottom DIP\" width=\"400\" height=\"100\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bend Connector to Provide Clearance\n",
    "Before connecting the Safari and Meerkat boards together it is necessary to modify one of the connectors. This will provide clearance for the Safari board and allow access to pins which are needed for the UART connection. Very carefully bend the 3 pins on connector J3 located next to the power input jack on the Meerkat board taking special care not to rip it off the board while doing so.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Meerkat_top_pins.jpeg\" alt=\"Meerkat Top Pins\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Meerkat_side_pins.jpeg\" alt=\"Meerkat Side Pins\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Connect Safari Mezzanine to Meerkat\n",
    "Assemble Safari board on top of Meerkat board using the mating low-speed connectors on each board. It should like this:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Safari-Kit-Assembled.jpg\" alt=\"Safari Kit Assembled\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Power Test\n",
    "Before connecting anything to the inputs it is a good idea to test the power to both the Meerkat and Safari boards first.\n",
    "1. Plug AC-to-DC power supply into AC wall outlet and insert barrel jack into receptacle on the Meerkat board.\n",
    "2. Check that all 4 LEDs on the Safari- red, blue, yellow, green- are on. These LEDs correspond to the following power supplies:\n",
    "       Red: 5VDC output from Meerkat\n",
    "       Blue: 1.8VDC output from Meerkat\n",
    "       Yellow: 3.3VDC supply 'AVDD' on Safari board\n",
    "       Green: 1.8VDC supply 'IOVDD' on Safari board\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Power_LEDs.jpeg\" alt=\"Power LEDs\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\"/>\n",
    "3. Check LEDs\n",
    "       (a) If these are all lit up, we are ready to go to the next step which is connecting the sensors. Remove power to the Meerkat board before proceeding to this step.\n",
    "       (b) If the LEDs are not all lit up, there is a problem with a power supply. Using a multimeter and the schematics, troubleshoot and identify the problem and fix before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safari Sensor Connections\n",
    "The demo software allows you to connect the Analog Devices ADXL203EB accelerometer eval board, Adafruit 3290 RTD temperature probe and Sensirion SDP816-125PA differential pressure sensor and view the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ADXL203EB Accelerometer Eval Board\n",
    "Connect 4-pin connector cable to the ADXL203EB accelerometer board leaving pin ST unconnected. Identify the color of the wire connected to pin +V on the ADLX203EB; connect the other end to Safari board connector J1 pin 1 (AVdd) and tighten down using a small screwdriver. Similarly connect the wire on pin X to J1 pin 2 (IN0) on Safari, and the wire on pin G to J1 pin 4 (ground). See picture below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adafruit 3290 RTD Temperature Probe\n",
    "This is a little tricky. Using 22-26 gauge insulated wire, cut small pieces and insert into terminal J2 on Safari as shown in these diagrams, tightening down on corresponding screws.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect wire between pins IN2 and REF+\n",
    "2. Connect wire between pins IN3 and IN5\n",
    "3. Connect wire between pins REF- and IN4\n",
    "4. Connect precision resistor between REF+ and REF-\n",
    "5. Now take the RTD probe and determine which two wires are connected together at one end by using an ohmmeter. Resistance should be approximately zero ohms. Take the wire which is not connected directly to the others (resistance approx 100 ohms) and connect to J2 pin 6 (IN4) (will have to loosen screw first). Take one of the remaining wires and connect to J2 pin 5 (IN5) and the other wire to J2 pin 6 (HDRM).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Safari_sensor_wiring.png\" alt=\"Safari Sensor Wiring\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensirion SDP816-125PA Differential Pressure Sensor\n",
    "1. Connect wiring harness to the pressure sensor\n",
    "2. Connect wires for OCS and GND together (pins 3 and 1- see diagram) then connect to AGND on board\n",
    "3. Connect wire from VDD on sensor (pin 2) to AVDD on board\n",
    "4. Connect wire from AOUT on sensor (pin 4) to IN6 on board\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Demo\n",
    "### 1. Connect UART Cable\n",
    "Connect the USB-to-UART cable between connector J3 on the Meerkat board and any available port on your PC.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/UART_connections.jpg\" alt=\"UART Connections\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Set Jumpers on Top of Safari Board\n",

    "### 3. Connect Power Supply\n",
    "Connect the 12V power supply to the Meerkat board. Wait approximately 15 seconds for the Meerkat to fully boot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Identify COM Port\n",
    "On your PC running Windows 10 open up Device Manager. Look under 'Ports' and make a note of which COM port the Meerkat is connected to. If there are multiple devices listed, you can unplug the USB cable and plug it back in to identify the right one.\n",
